Prerequisites
An ESXi 8u1 host with the VMware/ESXi provider installed and configured.
Access to the ESXi host with the appropriate permissions to create new VMs.
Basic knowledge of the VMware/ESXi provider and its configuration.
Steps
1. Create a new directory in your project repository to hold the configuration files for the new VM. For example:
mkdir myvm
2. Create a new file named myvm.tf in the new directory to define the configuration for the new VM.
3. Initialize the Terraform configuration in the myvm directory. For example:
terraform init
4. Plan the changes to create the new VM. For example:
terraform plan
5. Apply the changes to create the new VM. For example:
terraform apply
6. Verify that the new VM is running and accessible on the ESXi host.
For more information, see the `esxi_vm_creation` directory in this repository.
