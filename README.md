#Prerequisites

An ESXi 8u1 host with the VMware/ESXi provider installed and configured.

Access to the ESXi host with the appropriate permissions to create new VMs.

Basic knowledge of the VMware/ESXi provider and its configuration.

#Steps
1. Create a new directory in your project repository to hold the configuration files for the new VM. For example:
   
mkdir myvm

3. Create a new file named myvm.tf in the new directory to define the configuration for the new VM.

4. Initialize the Terraform configuration in the myvm directory. For example:

terraform init

5. Plan the changes to create the new VM. For example:

terraform plan

6. Apply the changes to create the new VM. For example:

terraform apply

7. Verify that the new VM is running and accessible on the ESXi host.

For more information, see the `esxi_vm_creation` directory in this repository.
